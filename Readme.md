# [Data Structures](https://junifruit.github.io/)

## Idea

This project is a small demonstration of different data structures. It visiually depicts how main operations of different data structures work

## Data Structures included

- HashMap
- LinkedList
- Heap
- Queue
- Stack

# How to use

1. Go to the [web-site](https://junifruit.github.io/)
2. Choose data structure you want to work with <br>

5. Perform an operation and see the result

# Tests

All the test are written with Jest library. You can check test cases for every data structure in corresponding folder.
